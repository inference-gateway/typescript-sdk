# List Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Inference Gateway SDK for listing models and MCP tools. It includes making requests to the SDK and handling responses using the TypeScript SDK.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **List All Models** - Retrieve all available models across providers
2. **List Provider-Specific Models** - Filter models by provider
3. **List MCP Tools** - Discover available Model Context Protocol tools
4. **Health Check** - Verify gateway connectivity

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the Inference Gateway running locally or have access to an instance. If not, please read the [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) section in the main README.

2. Install the SDK if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Set environment variables to see provider-specific examples:

   ```bash
   export PROVIDER=groq
   ```

4. Run the example:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Example Output

The example will show:

- Complete list of models grouped by provider
- Provider-specific model details (if PROVIDER is set)
- Available MCP tools (if EXPOSE_MCP is enabled)
- Gateway health status

## MCP Tools

To see MCP tools in action, ensure the gateway is started with:

```bash
EXPOSE_MCP=true docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ghcr.io/inference-gateway/inference-gateway:latest
```

## Supported Operations

- **Model Discovery** - Find all available models
- **Provider Filtering** - Get models from specific providers
- **Tool Discovery** - List available MCP tools and their schemas
- **Health Monitoring** - Check gateway status
