# MCP Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating how to use the Inference Gateway SDK with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools in a multi-provider architecture. Each example showcases different aspects of MCP tool integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Specific Examples

```bash

# Run interactive specialized agents
npm run example:nextjs-agent      # 🤖 Next.js development agent
npm run example:vite-agent        # ⚡ Vite application agent
npm run example:kubernetes-agent  # ☸️ Kubernetes operations agent
```

## Architecture

This example uses Docker Compose to orchestrate:

- **Inference Gateway** - Main API gateway with MCP support enabled
- **MCP Filesystem Server** - Provides file system operations (restricted to `/shared` and `/tmp`)
- **MCP Web Search Server** - Simulated web search and URL fetching
- **Optional Ollama** - Local model inference (when using `--profile with-ollama`)

## Important: Filesystem Access

The MCP filesystem server is configured with restricted access for security:

- **`/shared`** - Read-Write directory for shared files between the host and container
- **`/tmp`** - Read-write directory for temporary files inside of the container

The AI will only be able to access these directories. This prevents unauthorized access to system files.

## Sample Data

The `/shared` directory contains example files for testing.

## Supported Providers

All Inference Gateway providers work with MCP tools:

- `openai` - GPT models with excellent tool calling
- `groq` - Fast inference with Llama and Mixtral models
- `anthropic` - Claude models with strong reasoning
- `ollama` - Local models (use `--profile with-ollama`)
- `cohere` - Command models
- `deepseek` - DeepSeek models
- `cloudflare` - Workers AI models

## Using with Local Models (Ollama)

To include Ollama for local model inference:

```bash
docker-compose --profile with-ollama up -d
```

Then pull a model:

```bash
docker exec -it mcp_ollama_1 ollama pull llama3.2
```

Set environment variables:

```bash
export PROVIDER=ollama
export LLM=llama3.2
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Available

If you see "No MCP tools available":

1. Check if MCP servers are running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Verify MCP server logs:

   ```bash
   npm run compose:logs
   ```

3. Ensure the Inference Gateway can reach MCP servers:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/tools/list -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```

### Gateway Health Check Fails

If the gateway appears unhealthy:

1. Check gateway logs:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs inference-gateway
   ```

2. Verify API keys are set in `.env` file
3. Test direct connection:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

### Tool Calls Not Working

If tool calls fail during conversations:

1. Verify the model supports tool calling (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
2. Check MCP server connectivity through the gateway:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/tools/list \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   ```

3. Enable debug logging by adding to docker-compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - LOG_LEVEL=debug
   ```

## Custom MCP Servers

To add your own MCP server:

1. Add service to `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
   my-custom-mcp:
     image: my-mcp-server:latest
     ports:
       - '3002:3002'
     networks:
       - inference-network
   ```

2. Update Inference Gateway environment:

   ```yaml
   MCP_SERVERS: 'http://mcp-filesystem:3000/mcp,http://mcp-web-search:3001/mcp,http://my-custom-mcp:3002/mcp'
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   npm run compose:down
   npm run compose:up
   ```

## Notes

- MCP tools are called automatically by AI models when relevant to the conversation
- Tool schemas are defined by the MCP servers and exposed through the `/mcp/tools` endpoint
- Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities
- The Inference Gateway acts as a bridge between AI models and MCP tools
- Tool execution is streamed in real-time during conversations
- File operations are sandboxed to allowed directories for security
