# Sample Data for MCP Example

This directory contains sample files that can be accessed by the MCP filesystem server.

## Files

- `sample.txt` - A simple text file for testing file reading
- `data.json` - JSON data for testing structured file operations
- `config.yaml` - YAML configuration example

## Usage

These files can be accessed through MCP tools when the filesystem server is running. The AI models can read, analyze, and work with this data using the MCP file operations.
